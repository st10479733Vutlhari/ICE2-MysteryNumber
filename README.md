Mystery number challenge App README 

Overview 

This app is called the mystery number challenge which allows the user to guess a random generated number and receive feedback on whether the number guessed is too high, too low or correct. The app generates a random secret number between 1 and 100 and the user must guess the number. After each guess, the app provides feedback in the form of a message, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. 

 

 Features 

- Generates a random secret number between 1 and 100 

- Allows users to input their guesses 

- Validates user input to ensure it falls within the range of 1 to 100 

- Provides feedback on each guess (too high, too low or correct) 

- Tracks the number of guesses made 

- Ends the game when the user correctly guesses the secret number 

- Allows users to restart the game 

 

Input Validation 

The app validates user input in the textbox to ensure that the user enters a number between 1 and 100. If the user enters a number outside this range, they will be prompted to try again. This helps to prevent errors and ensures a smooth gaming experience. 

 

 Code Structure 

The app is built using React Native and TypeScript.  

- `styles`: A stylesheet defining the app’s layout and design 

 

 Requirements 

- React Native (>= 0.68.2) 

- TypeScript (>= 4.6.3) 

 

-1. Clone the repository 

 

Usage 

1. Open the app on your device or emulator 

2. Enter your guess in the input field (numbers between 1 and 100 only) 

3. Press the “Guess” button to submit your guess 

4. The app will provide feedback on your guess 

5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the secret number 

6. Press the “Restart Game” button to start a new game 

 

Known Issues 

Issues we encountered with the app were due to the incorrect syntax and react native component usage. The issues were resolved by fixing the syntax errors, properly using React Native components, fixing string interpolation and refining the logic which made the app work perfectly. 

 

Future Development 

Consider adding more features, such as multiple difficulty levels or a high score tracker 

Reflection 

While working on this group project, we have learnt the importance of communicating and working with each other. We encountered challenges with coding and debugging, as well as issues from the differences in each members coding experience and communication problems. Most importantly, we were able to overcome these issues as a group and work together to make sure the app was running perfectly.
